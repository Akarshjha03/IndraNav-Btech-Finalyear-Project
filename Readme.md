# Self-Driving Car with JavaScript 🚗💡

A fully functional self-driving car simulation built using vanilla JavaScript, featuring a neural network for autonomous navigation. No external libraries required! 🎯

## 🚀 Demo

Watch the tutorial: [Self-Driving Car with JavaScript](link-to-tutorial)

## 📌 Features

- 🏎️ Car simulation with physics-based motion
- 🧠 Neural network-based decision-making
- 🎯 Collision detection and lane navigation
- 📈 Machine learning with a simple backpropagation algorithm
- 🖥️ Customizable road and traffic settings

🖥️ Usage
Use the arrow keys to manually control the car (optional).
Refresh the page to restart the training process.
Adjust neural network parameters in network.js for better learning results.
💡 How It Works
The car senses its surroundings using raycasting sensors.
A neural network processes sensor data and determines the best steering actions.
The car continuously learns from interactions with obstacles and other cars.
